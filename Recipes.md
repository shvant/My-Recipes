Step 1
Combine oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, honey, garlic, seafood seasoning, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper in a nonreactive bowl or large resealable zip-top bag. Add mahi mahi and marinate for 8 hours, or overnight.

Step 2
At the same time, combine yogurt, lime juice, and cilantro for dressing in a bowl. Chill overnight while fish marinates.

Step 3
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove mahi mahi from marinade and place on a grill pan; discard excess marinade. Cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning as needed, about 5 minutes.

Step 4
Serve fish on warmed tortillas with dressing.
